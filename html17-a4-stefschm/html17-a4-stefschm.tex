    \section{Perceptron Learning}

    \textbf{Task.} We look at binary classification using a perceptron.
    We use two 2D datasets: a separable dataset $\mathcal{D}_1 (X1 \mbox{ and } y1)$ and a non-separable dataset $\mathcal{D}_2 (X2 \mbox{ and } y2)$.
    Both datasets include an additional bias feature.
